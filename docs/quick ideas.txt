1. 	Avoiding caret blinking for letters other than first letter.
				- just add animation properties to first letter.
				- as soon as a key is pressed remove the animation property.

		Implementation âœ…
				- Firstly don't have 'caret' class on first letter of first word then 'blink' 
					class do the job of adding it.
				- remove the 'blink' class as soon as the user types his/her first letter.
				- when user hits (cmd + backspace) then add the 'blink' class again.
				- when user goes to first letter of first word by hitting (ctrl + backspace)
					or (opt/alt + backspace) then add 'blink' class again.
				- when user uses his/her backspace key to go all the way to first letter 
				 	of first word then add a 'blink' caret again.
				
				Issue
						- the blinking caret vanishes away when we hit an incorrect letter
							also so debug it later.
