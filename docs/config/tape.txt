tape
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

you can actually have word tape mode as well, play.typeracer's "one line of scrolling text"
mode looks good and its less hurting to the eyes, it doesn't have caret though,
you can emulate it with caret added on top of it with word deletion also (bs, bs + meta)
it will look good
HERE'S WHAT THE UI SHOULD LOOK LIKE 
	- the text will be centerd like letter tape mode but there will be a vertical thin line
	- depending on the direction of scroll rtl or ltr left side of the vertical line will 
	  be completely opaque or right side show that it emulates play.typeracer ui instead
	  of monkeytype's
