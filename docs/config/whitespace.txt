don't need them anymore since ::after/::before does the job very well

- when user changes white from space to bullet/bar then intially give it a hard
color then then give the primary color, so that user sees it visually that
whitespace has changed
- regardless of whether highlight mode is letter or word or highlight mode is
turned off, when caret comes before the whitespace (bullet/bar), it should light up
- if user types in the whitepsace (space/bullet/bar) incorrectly then give a red
color when user types it correctly and caret moves forward, if whitespace is space
then give a lightpink background color to indicate typo
