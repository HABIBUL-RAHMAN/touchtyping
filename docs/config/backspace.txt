ðŸŸ¡ backspace
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
deletion (deletion of wrongly typed letters)
	- only backspacing
		deletes one letter at a time so NO concept of stopping at special
		symbols like ~`!@#$%^&*()-=_+{[]}|\;:"',<.>/?

	- backspace should work like normal texteditor, it should clear letters
		all the way to first letter of first word if the user keeps on hitting
		backspace

	- meta + backspace
		deletes all a wrongly/correctly typed letters at once putting the
		caret on first letter of first word.
		no concept of stopping on special characters

	- delete one word at a time
	  alt  + bs
		opt  + bs
		ctrl + bs
		deletes on word at a time, need to take a special care of special
		character like `~!@#$%^&*()-_+=[]\{}|;':",./<>?

		note: '_' is considered as text not special symbol when deleting

		Test this string by moving along with arrow keys & also deleting them
		with key combinations ctrl+bs & alt+bs

		- if text is before caret then delete till first special character
		  note that underscore and digits are considered as text when it is 
			mixed with text, so you when delete, stop after them (digit/underscore)
			use ctrl/alt + bs on these strings
			slfsle_)&#*$(#$*)fjfkfi38748lf
				    ^
			slfsle8)&#*$(#$*)
					  ^
			2`~!_@#$%^&*_()-064=+[]\_{}|hr23_;':",hr_34./<0>?
			^   ^           ^             ^ ^       ^ ^

		- if special character is before caret
					- then delete only that special character if there's only 1 special character
					- if there are multple special characters together (they're all same or different)
					  then delete all of them at once until first text character is encountered

windows:
	- ctrl + backspace (works like opt + backspace)
	- alt + backspace (doesn't work as expected)
			- so users of mac only can enjoy alt+bs not windows
	- fn + backspace/arrow (works like cmd key)
	- disable meta + bs by default (users can change it if they want to)
	- only ctrl/opt + bs (no alt+bs)

IMPORTANT POINTERS
	- clear an entire word and put the caret at the first letter of the current word
	- if caret is at first letter of a word then you should clear the previous word
		and put the creat on first letter of previous word

	- stoppers: mimic behaviour of backspacing in case special symbols are present
				      in the text i.e, caret should stop before the characters below
				      ~`!@#$%^&*()-=_+{[]}|\;:"',<.>/?
							please note that space character also acts like stoppers while 
							deleting using modifier keys
