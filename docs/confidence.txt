confidence
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

rule
	- low, default behaviour, can go back as much as user wants to correct mistakes
	- high, will not be able to go back to previous words to fix mistakes whether
	  previous word was typed correctly or incorrectly, but current word's errors
		can be fixed by using backspace
	- peak, won't be able to backspace at all i.e, backspacing will be turned off

dependencies
	- if confidence is at peak then backspace should be disabled and vice-versa i.e,
	  if backspace is disabled then confidence should be at peak
	- switching from peak confidence to low/high confidence should enable backspace
	- note that when backspace is enabled then user can switch to low or high confidence
	- confidence low means deletion of both types of word i.e, incorrect words and
	  correct words is possible but if deleteCorrectWord is disabled then
		confidence low will only delete incorrect words
