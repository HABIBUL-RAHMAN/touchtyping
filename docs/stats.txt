stats
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

When to call update stats function?
- whenever user hits a charcter, either it will be correct or incorrect so whenever
  the program flow goes inside these two blocks the first thing you do is make the
  necessary ui change, then call update state if live.after.every1keystroke is
  turned on.
- whenever user hits a space and the character which needs to be typed is a space
  then caret moves to next word, so before moving to next word (ui change i.e,
	putting caret on first letter of next word), call update stats function if
	live.after.every1word is turned on
- see a timer will always run to calculate time taken to type all letters in the
  text, the timer will either be turned on or turned off, if it is on then it will
	be visible in the ui and it will tick every second i.e, timer will increase
	by 1 after every second, but if timer is off then also timer will tick after
	every second but it will not be visible,
	so in the timer function we will check everytime if Config.live.after.every1second
	is turned on and call update stats

wpm
	total amount of characters in the correctly typed words (including spaces)
	divided by 5 and normalised to 60 seconds.

raw wpm
	calculated just like wpm, but also includes incorrect words

accuracy
	percentage of correctly pressed keys

char
	correct characters / incorrect characters, calculated after the test has ended

consistency
	based on the variance of your raw wpm. Closer to 100% is better, calculated
	using the coefficient of variation of raw wpm and mapped onto a scale 
	from 0 to 100

wpm | raw | accuracy | time | consistency | characters (correct|incorrect|extra|missed)
