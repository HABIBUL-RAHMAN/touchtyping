note: give pacecaret same color as caret but with reduced opacity

pacecaret
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. margin-left
2. left
3. transform: translateX(-x)

for bluring text on left & right and bluring top & bottom lines use filter: blur(),
opacity, ::before & ::after css properties or find similary
properties to achieve the desired result

smooth line scroll
	- user will get option to disable/enable line scroll
	- 4 lines will be visible by default
	- when lines will scroll upwards then top line ka adhaa faded hoga, bottom line
	  ka v adhaa faded hoga
		i mean when top line will scroll up then before vanishing its half portion
		will be fadeed out (linearly fading from most clear at bottom to least clear
		at the top)
		aur bottom line jo aaiga wo uske liye ulta hoga (linearly fading from bottom
		to be least clear and top to be most clear)

turn off forgive errors when user uses tape mode because there's width change
when all the inserted letters are deleted when user types in the correct letter
i.e, caret shifts to the left from its fixed position whenever there's letter
deletion

60 words per minute, meaning typing sixty words of length 5 in 60 seconds, it
means typing 300 characters in 60 seconds would give you 60wpm, so what is the
interval of time between two consecutive keystrokes
300 characters in 60000 milliseconds, means 1 character should be typed in 
60000/300 = 200ms (time difference between two consecutive keystrokes must be 200ms)
so if 200ms is for 60wpm then for 1wpm it will be 200/60 [(10/3)ms]

1 wpm = 10/3 ms

300 character = 60000 ms
  1 character = 60000 / 300 ms

you need to convert the wpm to character per minute in order to get interval in milliseconds
ms for 80wpm = 60000 / (80 * 5)
