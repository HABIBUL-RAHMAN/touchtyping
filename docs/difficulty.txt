ðŸŸ¡ difficulty
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

RULE
	- ease is the classic typing test experience
	- expert fails the test if you submit (press space) an incorrect word
	- master fails if you press a single incorrect key (need to type with 100% accuracy)

> in all three difficulty levels backspace is allowed (if user has not disabled it)
> lets not have any dependencies for difficulty, ease is the default, expert fails test
  if user submits wrong word and master fails test if single incorrect letter is typed
	in both expert and master insertion, deletion, replacement is possible, forgive needs
	to be taken care of in case of expert
